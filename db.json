Environmental scientists typically have a background in biology and chemistry but may also have backgrounds in engineering, information technology, law or public health. Depending on your chosen field, you may need to be certified in specific areas, such as hazardous materials management.\n\nThe type of job you can expect with a degree in environmental science will depend on the focus of your degree and your career goals. Some common career paths for environmental scientists include:\n\n* consultant\n* educator\n* environmental engineer\n* government scientist\n* research scientist\n* scientist for a private company\n\n#  What skills do you need to work in this field?\n\nThere are many different skills that you may need to work in this field. You will likely need strong problem solving skills, as you will often be required to find new and innovative ways to solve difficult issues. Communication skills are also important, as you will need to be able to effectively communicate with clients, coworkers, and other individuals in your field. Additionally, you should have a good understanding of the industry in which you work, as well as the latest trends and technologies. Finally, you should be able to work independently and be able to take initiative.\n\n#  How will the world be different in 2022?\n\nA lot can change in six years. In 2022, the world will be a very different place. Here are 5 predictions on how the world will be different in 2022:\n\n1. China will be the world’s largest economy\n\nIn 2020, China became the world’s largest economy in terms of GDP purchasing power parity (PPP), surpassing the United States. By 2022, China’s economy will be even larger, and it will be the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP nominal.\n\n2. The middle class will decline\n\nThe middle class has been a backbone of stability and growth for developed economies since the industrial revolution. However, over the next few years, the middle class will decline as automation and artificial intelligence (AI) cause jobs to disappear. This could lead to increased income inequality and social unrest.\n\n3. Renewable energy will overtake fossil fuels\n\nRenewable energy is already cheaper than fossil fuels in many parts of the world. By 2022, renewable energy will overtake fossil fuels as the primary source of energy worldwide. This shift away from traditional energy sources will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.\n\n4. Genomics sequencing will become commonplace\n\nGenomics sequencing is a process of decoding all of an organism’s DNA. By 2022, this process will become commonplace, as costs continue to decline and new applications for genomics sequencing are discovered. This could lead to major advances in medical treatments and personalized medicine.\n\n5. The internet of things will become ubiquitous\n\nThe internet of things is a network of devices that can communicate with each other autonomously. By 2022, it is expected that almost every object on earth will be connected to the internet of things. This could lead to massive efficiency improvements in all aspects of life, from transportation to healthcare\n\n#  What challenges will Environmental Scientists face in the future?\n\nEnvironmental Scientists will increasingly face challenges in the future as climate change causes more ecological disruptions. For example, they may need to grapple with invasive species that are spreading due to changing environmental conditions.\n\nIn addition, Environmental Scientists may need to find new ways to recycle materials and manage waste disposal, as traditional methods may no longer be effective. They may also need to develop strategies for preserving natural resources, such as water and forests, which are becoming increasingly scarce.\n\n Global temperatures are rising, sea levels are rising, and the world’s ice sheets are melting faster than ever before. These changes are all indications of human-caused climate change, and they pose serious risks to both people and nature. As a result, Environmental Scientists will have to work even harder in order to protect our planet and its inhabitants.\n\n#  What new technologies or methods will be used in Environmental Science in 2022?\n\nThe world is changing and with it, the field of Environmental Science. In 2022, new technologies and methods will be used to help us protect our environment and understand our planet better.\n\nOne new technology that will be used in Environmental Science in 2022 is satellite imagery. By using satellites, we can track deforestation, changes in land use, and other environmental changes from space. This can help us understand how human activities are impacting the environment and what we can do to mitigate those impacts.\n\nAnother new technology that will be used in Environmental Science in 2022 is machine learning. Machine learning can help us analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately. This can help us better understand environmental systems and how they are changing over time.\n\nFinally, traditional methods such as field studies and lab experiments will still be important in Environmental Science in 2022. Field studies can help us understand how ecosystems work in nature, while lab experiments can help us test the effects of different environmental variables on plants and animals.\n\nOverall, Environmental Science is evolving to keep up with the changing world around us. In 2022, we will use new technologies such as satellite imagery and machine learning to help us protect our environment and understand our planet better.","source":"_posts/What-kind-of-job-can-you-expect-with-a-degree-in-Environmental-Science.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What kind of job can you expect with a degree in Environmental Science\ndate: 2022-09-21 19:20:04\ncategories:\n- Environmental Science\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What kind of job can you expect with a degree in Environmental Science?\n\nAs an environmental scientist, you could expect to work in a variety of fields, including air quality assessment, water resources management, hazardous materials management and more.
