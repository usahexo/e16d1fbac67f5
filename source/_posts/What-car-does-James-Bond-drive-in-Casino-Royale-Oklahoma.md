#  What car does James Bond drive in Casino Royale Oklahoma?

In the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, Agent 007 drives a specially equipped Aston Martin DBS V12. The car has enough gadgets to make Q proud, from a smoke screen and oil slick dispenser to a glass-cutter mounted on the front.

While the car in the movie is fictional, there are actually quite a few Aston Martins that have been used in Bond films over the years. In fact, many of the Bond films have featured more than one type of Aston Martin.
The first Bond film to feature an Aston Martin was Goldfinger in 1964. The car was driven by Sean Connery as James Bond and was later auctioned off for charity in 2010.
Bond drove an Aston Martin again in Thunderball (1965), this time a DB5. The DB5 became one of the most famous cars in movie history and has made numerous appearances in other films and TV shows over the years.
Aston Martins continued to appear in Bond movies throughout the 1970s, but none were as iconic as the DB5. In 1981, Roger Moore drove an Aston Martin V8 in For Your Eyes Only.
The 1990s saw a shift away from classic British cars and towards high-tech vehicles such as BMWs and Harleys. However, Pierce Brosnan brought back the Aston Martin in GoldenEye (1995) with his DB5.
The 2000s saw even more technological advancements, but Daniel Craig brought back some classic style with his DBS V12 in Casino Royale Oklahoma . 
Which brings us back to the present – will we see another classic British car or something completely new in the next Bond film? Only time will tell…

#  Is there a specific car that Bond drives in the film?

There is no specific car that Bond drives in the film, but he is known for driving luxurious cars. In the past, he has driven a BMW Z8 and an Aston Martin DB10.

#  What kind of car is it?

There are all sorts of cars on the road these days. You have your small, fuel efficient cars that are great for getting around town. And then you have your large SUVs and pickup trucks that can tow boats and haul heavy equipment. But what kind of car is right for you?

If you're looking for a car that's really versatile, you might want to consider a crossover. Crossovers are a blend of cars and SUVs, offering the best of both worlds. They're typically smaller than SUVs, making them more fuel efficient, but they offer more cargo space than most cars. And because they have raised ride heights, they're also great for off-road driving.

If you want something that's stylish and sporty, you might want to consider a sports car. Sports cars are designed for performance and handling, so they're perfect if you like to drive fast and take corners quickly. They come in all shapes and sizes, from small two-seaters to large coupes.

If you need a vehicle that can carry a lot of people or equipment, you might want to consider a van or a truck. Vans are great for family trips, while trucks are perfect for hauling heavy items or pulling a trailer. They both come in standard and extended versions, so you can choose the one that's right for you.

No matter what kind of car you choose, make sure it's the right fit for your needs. Consider how often you'll be driving it, what type of terrain you'll be driving on, and how many people will be riding in it. Once you've narrowed down your choices, take it for a test drive to see how it feels behind the wheel.

#  How does he get the car?

It's a question that's been asked by many people, young and old, for years. How does he get the car? The answer is quite simple, but it's something that not many people know.

The man gets the car by stealing it. He breaks into people's homes or businesses and takes their cars without them knowing. He's been doing this for years and has never been caught.

The police have tried to catch him, but they've never been able to. They don't know how he does it or where he hides the cars. All they know is that he's been stealing them for a long time and that he needs to be stopped.

But the man is smart and knows how to avoid getting caught. He knows which neighborhoods to stay away from and how to hide the cars once he gets them. He's never been caught and doesn't plan on being caught anytime soon.

So how does he get the car? By stealing it. It's as simple as that. And he's very good at it too, which is why he's never been caught.

#  Why did the filmmakers choose that particular car for Bond?

There are a few reasons that the filmmakers might have chosen that car for Bond. It could be that the car is incredibly fast and makes for great action scenes, or that it's durable and perfect for stunts. It could also be that the car has a certain mystique or cool factor that makes it perfect for Bond. Whatever the reason, the filmmakers likely chose that car because it is suited for the character and the story they are trying to tell.
