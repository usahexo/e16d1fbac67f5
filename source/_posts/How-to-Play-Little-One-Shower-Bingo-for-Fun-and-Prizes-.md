#  How to Play Little One Shower Bingo for Fun and Prizes 

If you're in the market for a fun, new, shower game to play with your friends and family, look no further than Little One Shower Bingo! This easy-to-learn game can be played by people of all ages and it guarantees lots of laughs and good times.

The premise of the game is simple - each player takes turns calling out things that they see in the shower (e.g., "Little one washing their hair!"). The first player to get 5 in a row on their bingo card wins the game.

To make things more interesting, you can set up some fun prizes for the winners. Some ideas include: getting first dibs on the best shower spot, taking an early turn in the shower, or getting a free pass on doing the dishes for the day.

Ready to give Little One Shower Bingo a try? Here's how to play:

1. Print out a copy of our free bingo card template (available at [LINK]) - we recommend printing multiple cards in case someone gets 5 in a row early.

2. Cut out the individual squares on the bingo card.

3. Place one square in each of 5 different spots around your shower (make sure they're all different angles so it's not too easy for players). NOTE: If you have a particularly small shower, you can place more than 5 squares around the perimeter - just make sure each spot has a different item pictured on it.

4. Hand out one card to each player. NOTE: If there are more than 5 players, print out multiple copies of the cards or use another type of grid such as a crossword or Sudoku grid with 5x5 squares.

5. Play begins with the player who most recently showered starting off by calling out "Little one washing their hair!". The next player then either snaps their fingers if they see that exact item or calls out another item listed on their card. If they don't see that particular item, they simply skip their turn and move onto the next player who then takes their turn calling out an item from their card.
The first person to get 5 squares in a row either diagonally, horizontally or vertically (depending on which type of grid you're using) shouts "BINGO!" and wins the game!

#  How to Play Baby Shower Bingo for All the Fun and Excitement 

Baby shower bingo is one of the most popular games to play at a baby shower. It is easy to learn and can provide hours of enjoyment for all of the guests. Whether you are hosting a baby shower or attending one, be sure to play baby shower bingo!

The game consists of a card with 25 squares. Each square has a different item that might be found at a baby shower. The items can be anything from infant clothes to diaper pins. Guests take turns drawing cards and crossing off squares as they are mentioned during the course of the shower. The first guest to cross off all of the squares on their card wins!

There are many different versions of baby shower bingo available online, so choose the ones that best fit your needs. If you are attending a baby shower, be sure to ask the host if they will be playing baby shower bingo. If they are not, offer to bring along a set of cards for everyone to enjoy.

No matter which version you choose, there are a few things that are always included in baby shower bingo. First, there is usually a list of items that must be crossed off in order to win the game. These items vary depending on the theme of the baby shower, but might include things like diapers, bottles, or pacifiers. Second, many versions of baby shower bingo have either pictures or words representing each item on the list. This makes it easy for guests to know which item they need to cross off their card. Finally, most versions of baby shower bingo include a free space somewhere on the card. This space can be used by guests who haven’t been called on to read or speak yet or by those who just want to take a break from the game.

#  How to Play Shower Bingo with all the Bells and Whistles 

Ever since the game of bingo was created in the 1500s, people have been finding new and innovative ways to play it. The classic game can now be enjoyed by using shower tiles as your playing board! This tutorial will show you how to set up your game board and mark off your squares, as well as how to win the big bucks.

**TO PLAY:**

1. Choose a shower with at least 10 tiles. If your shower has fewer tiles than this, you can either use masking tape or cardboard to create extra squares on which to play.

2. Decide on a winning pattern. The simplest pattern is five in a row, but you can get more creative if you like.

3. Label each tile with a number from 1-10 (or however many tiles your shower has).

4. Using a permanent marker, draw a square around each tile on the floor of the shower. Make sure the squares are big enough to fit at least one foot inside them.

5. Take a seat in the shower and get ready to play!


To mark off your squares, simply step inside the square with one foot fully inside it. If you’re playing with others, have one person call out the numbers as they’re called out by the bingo caller. When someone wins, have them celebrate by jumping for joy or perhaps taking a quick sip of their beverage of choice!

#  The Best Way to Play Baby Shower Bingo

So you’ve been invited to a baby shower and want to bring a fun game along. Bingo is always a hit, but how can you make it special for a baby shower? Here are some tips for the best way to play baby shower bingo!

-Instead of calling out numbers, have guests call out baby items. For example, “diaper,” “bottle,” or “pacifier.”

-Include both boy and girl items on your cards, as well as items that could be used for either gender. This will ensure that everyone can play regardless of their knowledge about babies.

-Make it a team game by dividing players into two or more teams. Have one player from each team draw a card and then call out the item on the card. The first team to fill up their grid wins!

-If you want to make the game even more challenging, don’t include any pictures of the items on the cards. Just list the item name and its description. For example, “a soft, cuddly toy that is often given to newborns.”
