#  5 easy steps to successfully withdrawing from Bingo Battle Yemen

The Bingo Battle in Yemen is coming to an end, and the Saudi-led coalition is claiming victory. The Houthis have now been pushed out of the port city of Hodeidah and are retreating from other strategic areas. This leaves the coalition in control of most of Yemen’s major population centers.

Now that the Houthis are on the ropes, what should be done to ensure a successful withdrawal from Bingo Battle Yemen? Here are five easy steps:

1. Establish a safe zone for displaced civilians

One of the main concerns during any military operation is civilian casualties. In order to minimize the risk to civilians, it is important to establish a safe zone for them to flee to. This could be done either through negotiations with the Houthis or by using force to create a buffer zone.

2. Secure passage for humanitarian aid

Another key concern is ensuring that humanitarian aid can reach those who need it most. This will require secure passage for aid workers and trucks carrying food and medical supplies. It may also require establishing distribution hubs in safe areas away from the frontline.

3. Cooperate with local leaders

It is important to work with local leaders in order to get buy-in from the population and reduce the risk of violence against coalition troops. Local leaders can also help identify safe routes for civilians and provide crucial intelligence on enemy movements.

4. Avoid collateral damage

The coalition must take every precaution to avoid inflicting unnecessary collateral damage on civilian infrastructure and neighborhoods. This includes using precision-guided munitions and not striking targets that could result in large numbers of civilian casualties.

5. Prepare for the aftermath

Withdrawing from Bingo Battle Yemen will not be the end of the story; there will be a need for long-term planning and assistance to help rebuild the country after years of conflict. The coalition must provide assistance in areas such as education, health care, and economic development in order to ensure that Yemen does not relapse into chaos after the fighting ends
