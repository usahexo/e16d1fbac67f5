#  DSM-5 Lists Five Characteristics of Problem Gambling Behavior

The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has just been released, and with it comes a new definition of problem gambling behavior. The DSM-5 identifies five characteristics of problem gambling behavior:

1. Preoccupation with gambling - thoughts of gambling persistently enter the person's mind, even when they don't want them to.

2. Tolerance - the person needs to gamble more often or bet more money to achieve the desired excitement.

3. Withdrawal symptoms - the person experiences negative emotions when not able to gamble. This may include irritability, anxiety, or restless sleep.

4. Losses accumulate - the person experiences mounting losses as a result of gambling.

5. Impairment in personal, family, or work life - problems in any of these areas are caused or exacerbated by gambling behavior.

#  How to Know If You or a Loved One Has a Gambling Problem

Money is a powerful motivator. For some, it can be a driving force to achieve great things. For others, it can lead to harmful and destructive behaviors like gambling. Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time or an enjoyable social experience, but for some people it can become an addiction.

If you or someone you love has been gambling more than you’d like, there are some warning signs that can help you determine if there is a problem. The following are eight signs that someone may have a gambling problem:

1) thoughts of gambling constantly consume your mind - If you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time, even when you’re not doing it, this could be a sign of a problem.

2) needing to gamble more and more money to get the same feeling - Gambling should never be about trying to make up for previous losses. If you find yourself needing to bet larger amounts of money in order to feel the same excitement or thrill, this could be a sign of addiction.

3) lying about how much money was gambled or lost - Lying about how much money was gambled or lost is often an attempt to hide the extent of the problem from loved ones.

4) hiding gambling activity from loved ones - Hiding your gambling activity from loved ones is another sign that there may be a problem. This could include hiding receipts, avoiding conversations about gambling, or making up excuses for why you were absent from social events or work.

5) feeling anxious or depressed when not gambling - When someone is addicted to gambling, they may experience negative feelings like anxiety or depression when they’re not able to gamble. This can often lead them to continue gambling in order to try and alleviate these feelings.

6) borrowing or stealing money to gamble with - Gambling with borrowed money or stealing money in order to gamble is a clear sign that there is a serious problem.

7) being unable to control your betting habits - If you find yourself betting more than you planned on or spending more time gambling than intended, this is a sign that you may not be in control of your gambling habits.

8 ) experiencing financial problems due to gambling addiction - One of the most obvious signs that there is a problem with gambling is financial problems caused by excessive betting. This could include having debts piling up, losing important possessions due to unpaid bets, or not being able to afford basic necessities because money was spent on gambling instead

#  Gambling Disorder Now Recognized as a Mental Health Condition

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has recognized gambling disorder as a mental health condition. The condition will be listed in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is set to be released in May 2013.

Gambling disorder is characterized by an inability to resist gambling impulses, continued gambling despite negative consequences, and preoccupation with gambling. The condition can lead to significant financial, social, and emotional problems for the individual.

"Gambling disorder is a serious mental illness that can have devastating consequences for individuals and families," said APA President Dr. Dilip Jeste. "It is important that we recognize this disorder as a legitimate mental health condition and provide the necessary resources for treatment."

Treatment for gambling disorder typically includes cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication, and self-help groups.

#  What Does DSM-5 Mean for People With Gambling Disorders?

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has been released, and with it, a new classification for gambling disorders. The DSM-5 replaces the DSM-IV, and includes updated information on diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders.

What Does DSM-5 Mean for People With Gambling Disorders?

The DSM-5 classification of gambling disorders is largely similar to the DSM-IV classification. However, there are some changes that may be significant for people with gambling disorders.

The most notable change is that the DSM-5 now recognizes problem gambling as an addiction. This means that people with gambling disorders will now be eligible for treatment through programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA).

Prior to the release of the DSM-5, there was some debate about whether or not problem gambling should be classified as an addiction. Some people felt that problem gambling was too different from other addictions to be included in the same category. However, research has shown that problem gambling shares many similarities with other addictions, including compulsive behavior and relapse risk.

In addition to recognizing problem gambling as an addiction, the DSM-5 also includes new criteria for diagnosing gambling disorders. To be diagnosed with a gambling disorder, you must now meet at least two out of four criteria:

You have gambled more often than you intended or you have been unable to stop gambling. You have been spending more money on gambling than you can afford. You have been feeling distressed or had problems in your life because of your gambling. You have been trying but failing to control your gambling behavior.

These changes in the diagnostic criteria may make it easier for people to get help for their gambling problems.
