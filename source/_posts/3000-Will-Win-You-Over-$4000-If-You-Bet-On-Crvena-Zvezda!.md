#  3000 Will Win You Over $4000 If You Bet On Crvena Zvezda!

3000 will win you over 4000 dollars if you bet on Crvena Zvezda! The Belgrade side are in fine form coming into this tie and have a great chance of progressing. Here is why you should back them to win!

Form:

The home side come into this fixture having won four of their last five games, while losing the other. They’re scoring goals for fun at the moment, with 15 in their last five fixtures. This suggests they will be too much for NK Maribor to handle.

 NK Maribor:

The Slovenian side come into this fixture with just one win in their last five games. This includes defeats to both AEK Athens and Olympiacos in the Europa League. They may struggle against the rampant home side.

#  3000 US Dollars Made On Crvena Zvezda This Evening!

There’s been plenty of money flowing around in European football this evening, with some huge sums changing hands in the aftermath of some high-profile fixtures.

One particular deal which may have slipped under the radar is the one which saw Crvena Zvezda – more commonly known as Red Star Belgrade – land a 3000 US dollar windfall following their 2-1 victory over Radnicki Nis.

Just what was behind this sizeable payout? Well, it turns out that 30-year-old striker Richmond Boakye scored both of Red Star’s goals on the night, and as a result he’s now become the first player this season to reach 20 goals in all competitions.

Boakye is something of a journeyman striker, having played for clubs including Juventus, Sassuolo and Atalanta during his career so far. However, it’s fair to say that he’s never really had things his own way at any of those stops; often finding himself shipped out on loan to various different sides.

This season has been different though, as Boakye has finally found some stability at Red Star and he’s repaid them by firing them to the top of the Serbian SuperLiga. In truth, it would be something of a surprise if he weren’t snapped up by a bigger club in the summer given his recent form; but until then, he looks likely to continue banging in the goals for Red Star.
