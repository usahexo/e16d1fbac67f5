# The Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a card game that is played between the player and the dealer. The objective of the game is to score 21 points or more on your first two cards, without going over. If you score 21 points with your first two cards, you win automatically!

If your total score is less than 21, you can choose to either hit (draw another card) or stand (end your turn). The goal is to beat the dealer’s total score without going over 21. If you bust (score more than 21), then you lose automatically.

Here are some important things to remember when playing blackjack:

-The Ace is worth 1 point or 11 points, whichever is better for you.
-A 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
-Any King, Queen, or Jack is worth 10 points.
-An Ace and a 10 equals 21 points (a Blackjack). This is the best possible hand in the game.
-The dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more.
-You can double down on any two cards. This means that you double your bet and receive just one more card. You cannot hit after doubling down.

# Double down for big wins

Doubling down is one of the most exciting moves in blackjack, and it can also be one of the most profitable. When you double down, you double your bet and receive just one more card. This move is most beneficial when you have a strong hand (10 or 11) and the dealer is showing a low card (2 through 6). By doubling down, you give yourself a chance to win big with just one more card!



#  Study how to play blackjack and get the best bonuses available!

If you want to enjoy the casino experience while playing blackjack, then learning how to play the game is a must. Not only will this give you the ability to make educated decisions while playing, but it can also help improve your chances of winning. Furthermore, if you’re looking for the best bonuses available, then check out our guide on where to find them.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games and can be enjoyed at both brick-and-mortar and online casinos. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than them without going over, or by having a higher total than the dealer without going above 21. Players are dealt two cards face up and the dealer is given one card face down and one card face up. After all players have had their turn, the dealer reveals their second card and completes their hand. If the dealer has a total of 16 or less, they must hit; if they have 17 or more, they must stand.

Players can choose to hit (take another card), stand (stick with what they have), double (double their bet and get one more card), split (split their cards into two separate hands) or surrender (give up half their bet and end their turn). When making any of these choices, it’s important to remember that hitting always risks going over 21, standing means you might not get as close to 21 as you could have, doubling increases your bet size significantly and splitting allows you to play two hands which gives you more options in terms of strategy.

As was mentioned earlier, when looking for bonuses it’s important to do some research in order to find reputable casinos that offer attractive bonus schemes. Some bonuses that can be found include deposit matches (where the casino matches a percentage of your deposit amount), free spins on slots games and bonus cash which can be used on blackjack and other table games. It’s also important to read through the terms and conditions associated with each bonus before accepting it so that you know exactly what is required of you.

# The Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a simple card game that is played with one or more decks of cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by collecting cards that total 21, or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player's hand is compared to the dealer's hand, and the player wins if their hand is higher than the dealer's hand. If the player's hand is lower than the dealer's hand, they lose.

In blackjack, each card has a point value. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points. If a player receives two cards of the same rank (two 5s, for example), then they have what is called a "pair". When this happens, the player has the option of "splitting" their pair into two separate hands, and playing each hand separately.

If a player receives an Ace and a 2 card (a total of 3), they can choose to either "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (end their turn). If they hit and receive another 2 card (a total of 5), then they would have 20 points - which is considered a good hand. If they hit again and receive an Ace (a total of 6), they would go over 21 and would automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has.

The number of cards that can be drawn in any given turn is determined by what is called the "deck penetration". This measures how deep into the deck the dealer goes before shuffling. The deeper into the deck that the dealer goes, the more opportunity there is for players to draw additional cards without going over 21. In general, it is best to stand on totals of 14 or greater, as this gives players more chance to beat'em dealers upcard while also minimising risk of busting out themselves.

# Basic Strategy for Blackjack

There are numerous ways to play blackjack - but only a handful that will give you statistically favourable odds against the house edge. Probability theory dictates that there are specific plays which offer an expected return greater than 1%, meaning that over time these plays will net you wins above and beyond your losses when compared against basic strategy alternatives. Here are some essential basic strategy plays:


-Splitting pairs: When you are dealt two cards of equal rank - such as two eights - splitting them into two separate hands gives you twice as much chance to win! Always split Aces and 8s if possible - most other pairs should be split only if your first two cards have identical values (such as two twos).

-Standing on totals of 17 or greater: As mentioned earlier, standing on totals between 17-21 gives players better odds against being defeated by dealers upcard . Hitting on totals lower than 17 can often lead to busting out , so it’s best avoided whenever possible.

-Insurance: When dealt an Ace as your first card , casinos will offer insurance in case the next card dealt equals 10 (making for a blackjack). Insuring your bet costs half your original bet amount, but pays out 2-1 should blackjack be made. It’s usually advisable not to take insurance - especially when counting cards - but it’s still something worth considering when making larger wagerse .

While employing basic strategy won't always result in guaranteed wins against casino odds - it will put you at an advantage when playing blackjack nonetheless! For even better chances at winning at blackjack , consider using one our top recommended techniques detailed below...
