If you feel that you have been wronged by Genii Casino, there are a few places to turn.

The first place to go is the casino's licensing authority. In most cases, this will be the government of the country where the casino is located. The licensing authority will be responsible for regulating the casino, and should be able to help resolve any disputes you may have.
