#  Neymar scores hat-trick in 7-0 rout of Osasuna as Barcelona stay perfect in La Liga

Neymar scored a hat-trick as Barcelona stayed perfect in La Liga with a 7-0 rout of Osasuna on Sunday.

Luis Suarez opened the scoring in the eighth minute at Camp Nou before Neymar took over, netting twice in the first half and again after the break.

Ivan Rakitic and Arda Turan also got on the scoresheet for Barcelona, who have now won all six of their league games this season.

Barca are two points clear of Sevilla and Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, while Osasuna are one of four teams still without a point this season.

#  Suarez brace sees Barcelona maintain 100% start to season

A brace from Luis Suarez saw Barcelona maintain their 100% start to the season with a 3-0 victory over Eibar.

The Uruguayan striker opened the scoring in the first half, before doubling the lead after the interval with an emphatic finish.

Paco Alcacer also got on the scoresheet late on, as Ernesto Valverde's side made it six wins from six in La Liga.

Barcelona are looking like ominous title contenders once again, and they will be looking to make it seven victories out of seven when they take on Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League on Wednesday night.

#  Neymar, Suarez lead Barcelona to easy win over Eibar

 Neymar led the way with a brace as Barcelona eased to a 3-0 victory over Eibar on Tuesday night.

Luis Suarez assisted Neymar for the opener, before doubling the lead himself just before halftime. Neymar added a third in second-half stoppage time to secure all three points for the visitors.

Eibar were competitive in the early stages and had their chances, but Barcelona eventually took control and proved too much for them in the end.

The result keeps Barcelona unbeaten in La Liga this season and moves them five points clear of second-place Atletico Madrid.

#  Historic night for Suarez as Barcelona beat Granada 6-0

It was a historic night for Luis Suarez as he scored four goals in Barcelona’s 6-0 win over Granada.

The Uruguayan striker has been in sensational form this season and he continued his fine run of goalscoring form against Granada. Suarez opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a well-taken strike and then doubled Barca’s lead 10 minutes later with a header.

He completed his hat-trick in the 58th minute with another well-worked goal and then added his fourth and Barcelona’s sixth in the 74th minute with another header. The result means Barcelona move up to second place in La Liga, two points behind leaders Atletico Madrid.

For Suarez, it was an incredible night as he became only the third player ever to score four goals in a La Liga game for Barcelona. He joins the great trio of Lionel Messi and Real Madrid legends Alfredo Di Stefano and Cristiano Ronaldo in accomplishing this feat.

#  Messi rested as Neymar, Suarez lead Barcelona to 3-0 win

Neymar and Suarez starred for Barcelona as the Catalans cruised to a 3-0 win over Malaga on Saturday, with Messi watching from the sidelines.

Neymar opened the scoring in the ninth minute, before Suarez doubled the advantage just after halftime. Neymar then added a third in injury time to seal the victory.

With the win, Barcelona provisionally moved up to second place in La Liga, four points behind league-leaders Real Madrid.

Messi was rested by manager Luis Enrique, who brought in Rafinha and Arda Turan in attack. And it was Neymar who made the most of his opportunity, taking his tally for the season to 18 goals in all competitions.

Suarez was also on target, scoring his 20th goal of the season. The Uruguayan has now scored against 29 different teams in La Liga – more than any other player in history.

Barcelona’s victory was never really in doubt, but it was a good test for them ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain.
