The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by reaching a total score of 21 or less, without going over. </p>
<p>The game is played with two decks of cards, and each player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards, one face up and one face down. The player can then choose to hit (take another card) or stand (stay with their current total). If the player goes over 21, they lose the hand. If the dealer goes over 21, all players still in the hand win. </p>
<p>The player’s goal is to beat the dealer’s total score, without going over 21. This can be done by either getting a higher score than the dealer, or by having the dealer bust (going over 21).</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-key-rules-of-European-Blackjack"><a href="#What-are-the-key-rules-of-European-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What are the key rules of European Blackjack?"></a>What are the key rules of European Blackjack?</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Played by both beginners and experienced players, blackjack is a game of skill and chance that can be enjoyed by everyone. European blackjack is a variation of the game that has become increasingly popular in recent years. If you’re looking to play this version of blackjack, it’s important to learn the key rules first.</p>
<p>In European blackjack, players are dealt two cards face up and the dealer is given two cards, one face up and one face down. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Players can hit (draw more cards) or stand (stick with the cards they have). If they go over 21, they bust and lose the hand. The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17.</p>
<p>The player’s hand is always compared to the dealer’s hand, even if the player busts. If the player has a higher total than the dealer, they win; if the dealer has a higher total than the player, they lose. In European blackjack, there are no splits or surrenders allowed. If you want to split or surrender your hand, you would need to play American blackjack instead.</p>
<p>Knowing these key rules is essential for playing European blackjack correctly. So next time you visit your favourite online casino, why not give this version of blackjack a try?</p>
<h1 id="What-does-the-game-offer-players-in-terms-of-wagers-and-payouts"><a href="#What-does-the-game-offer-players-in-terms-of-wagers-and-payouts" class="headerlink" title="What does the game offer players in terms of wagers and payouts?"></a>What does the game offer players in terms of wagers and payouts?</h1><p>The game offers players a variety of wagers and payouts. In terms of wagers, the game offers players the option to bet on a single number, multiple numbers, red or black, odd or even, and 1-18 or 19-36. The payouts vary depending on which bet is placed. For example, if a player bets on a single number and wins, they will be paid out 35:1. However, if they bet on red or black and win, they will only be paid out 1:1. </p>
<p>In terms of payouts, the game offers some of the best odds in the casino. Players can expect to receive payouts between 96% and 98%, which is significantly higher than many other casino games. This means that players have a better chance of winning money when playing Roulette than when playing other games.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-of-the-more-notable-features-available-in-European-Blackjack"><a href="#What-are-some-of-the-more-notable-features-available-in-European-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What are some of the more notable features available in European Blackjack?"></a>What are some of the more notable features available in European Blackjack?</h1><p>When playing blackjack in a casino, whether it’s land-based or online, there are a variety of different rules and game options to choose from. In European blackjack, also known as “single deck blackjack”, the game is played with just one deck of cards, making for a potentially more advantageous game for the player. There are also various rule variations that can be found in this version of the game that can further benefit the player. </p>
<p>For instance, sometimes dealers must hit on soft 17 (Ace-6), while other times they must stand on all 17s. In some cases players can split cards twice (3s, 6s, 9s and 12s), while in others they can only split once. Doubling down is also an option available to players in European blackjack more often than not. These rule variations add an extra level of strategy and decision making to the game, making it more challenging and fun for players. </p>
<p>Additionally, in European blackjack there is usually only one betting round per hand as opposed to the two rounds common in other types of blackjack games. This single betting round makes the game faster-paced compared to some of its counterparts, keeping players engaged throughout the entire session.</p>

With the industry constantly growing, it can be hard to determine which games are worth your time. However, we believe that [this game] is definitely one that players should give a try.</p>
